#### Study materials for ML and DL 

Hello folks, I’m planning to initiate a series of (long running) ML/Deep Learning sessions here in Bangalore office twice a week, to start with. Since this is an area where we need more in depth knowledge, I think it’s going to be a good investment of our time if we can go deeper into the how and the why of things, while keeping an emphasis on the applicability as well. Besides that, it’d also be a good learning opportunity for me since I need to brush up my old knowledge, and it’s about time that I get myself familiarized with some of the cutting edge algorithms in the field of AI. My preferred timing is Tuesday and Thursday, 10 - 11 am, as mornings work out best for me. Below are the high level topics that I intend to cover. It’d probably take around 4 - 6 months to complete all of these materials in sufficient depth. I’m planning to prepare a pdf and a jupyter notebook for each logical section. Do let me know your thoughts on this.
